## Writing Your First Python Program in VSCode

Creating and running a Python program is an exciting first step in coding. In this section, you'll write and execute the classic "Hello World" program in Python using VSCode.

### Creating a New Python File

1. In VSCode, start a new file by selecting File > New File from the menu (or using the shortcut `Ctrl+N`/`Cmd+N`).
2. Save this file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello.py`, indicating it's a Python script.

### Writing the Hello World Program

1. In your new `hello.py` file, enter the following Python code:

   ```
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

2. After typing the code, save your script (shortcut `Ctrl+S`/`Cmd+S`).

### Running the Program

1. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode to run your script:
   - Do this by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu.
   - Alternatively, use the shortcut ``Ctrl+` (Windows/Linux)`` or ``Cmd+` (macOS)``.
2. In the terminal, type `python hello.py` and press Enter.
3. If everything is set up correctly, you'll see "Hello, World!" printed in the terminal, signaling that your program has run successfully.
